# Mixed Precision Deep Learning
Mixed precision training - where different numerical precisions are used at different stages of model training - has emerged as a promising approach for reducing training time and memory usage in deep learning. While prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of specialized low-precision formats and techniques, it remains unclear whether mixed precision can function as a **general-purpose** strategy using standard precision formats commonly available to practitioners. In this work, we present an empirical evaluation of mixed precision training across two domains, vision and natural language processing (NLP), using four representative deep learning models: ResNet-18, Resnet-50, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT. We compare full single-precision (FP32), full half-precision (FP16), and mixed FP16–FP32 training schemes in terms of training speed, memory usage, and classification accuracy on CIFAR-100 and Fashion-MNIST (vision datasets) as well as IMDB and Emotion (NLP datasets). Our results show that mixed precision consistently delivers substantial computational benefits with minimal accuracy degradation across domains, with some light evidence that mixed precision may even act as an implicit regularizer in some settings. Our findings support mixed precision training as a practical, general-purpose technique and provide actionable guidance for machine learning practitioners.
